# AppliedPsychologyLab
I worked in the UT Applied Psychology Lab from June 2022 to June 2023. During this time, I spearheaded many research activities to improve Finding Focus, a minduflness-based attention training course for high schoolers, including a study on student perceptions and another on the efficacy of a shorter 10-day course. 
The results of those studies are not available here because I must request permission before I display anything, but I do have permission to post some of my other projects. 
The two projects listed here were part of my effort to automate data cleaning, analysis, and reporting using R:

1. **Automate Data Cleaning Project**: Valuable time was spent cleaning semesterly datasets by hand and quality data was being lost, so I set out to automate and upgrade this process. I established rules for removing duplicates, matched pre- and post-course surveys, and created reusable code.
2. **Personalized Research Reports**: We provided personalized research reports to teachers each semester. This was previously a very time consuming process because each teacher's results were computed individually and there was not a standardized report format.
   I simplified and standardized the creation of personalized teacher research reports using an R Markdown document in which teacher name could be input once to receive a teacherâ€™s personalized report.
